# Fritsch Solitons Requirements Specification

What I am calling the Fritsch method is a way to create dark solitons at arbitrary position and velocity by simultaneously engineering the amplitude and phase of the condensate wave function. This is supposed to be a better approach compared to the technique we demonstrated before which manipulated the condensate phase only.

    qmf.get_login()

    fs = FristchSoliton(qmf)

    phi = 1 # in pi units
    fs.set_imprinting_phase(phi)

    matter = ps.get_matter()

    matter.submit(sim=True)
