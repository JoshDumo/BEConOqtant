# Fritsch Solitons Requirements Specification

What I am calling the Fritsch method is a way to create dark solitons at arbitrary position and velocity by simultaneously engineering the amplitude and phase of the condensate wave function. This is supposed to be a better approach compared to the technique we demonstrated before which manipulated the condensate phase only.
